# NetLogo-AI

## Project Idea
To teach AI how to shoot projectiles at each other. Two turtles start off with random weights and biases on their neural networks, but as generations go on they adapt to have better aim, better dodging skills, and more fluid movement to try and defeat the other turtle.
