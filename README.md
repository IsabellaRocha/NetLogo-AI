# NetLogo-AI

Project Idea
To teach AI how to shoot projectiles at each other
Based off of an idea we saw in a youtube video of two AI learning how to fight
Two turtles start off with random weights on their neural networks, but as generations go on they adapt to have better aim, better dodging skills, and more fluid movement to try and defeat the other turtle. 
Objectives of you and AI:
Defeat the other turtle by shooting them three times before they can shoot you three times
